# 🍽️ Simple Recipes Page (HTML Project)

This is my very first HTML project! I created a simple recipe website with three Nigerian dishes: **Jollof Rice**, **Fried Rice**, and **Yam with Egg Sauce**.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basic HTML structure
- How to add images, text, and organize content
- How to use lists, headings, and create recipe cards

## 💡 Features
- Clean and easy-to-read layout
- Three recipe sections with ingredients and steps
- Beginner-friendly HTML only (no CSS frameworks yet)

## 🚀 How to View It
1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP
2. Open `index.html` in any browser
